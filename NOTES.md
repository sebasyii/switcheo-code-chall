# Problem 2

- I assumed that OTP field would be a 6 digit number.
- I used these technologies, frameworks and libraries.
  - React
  - Next.js
  - Mantine UI, their in-built hooks.

# Problem 3

- Added a Datasource Class with JSDoc.
- Created 2 private methods, mid and quote to pass in to the getPrices method.

# Problem 4

- Based on the sample output, I added a minimum fraction digits to 8 decimal places.

# Problem 5

- I am not sure whether it is the desired output as I am unable to get the output to match the sample output. I am getting two more default key outputs.
